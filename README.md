# Browser-Based Python Interpreter and Action Runner

## Overview

This project allows users to run Python code directly in their web browser using Pyodide, a port of CPython to WebAssembly. It also demonstrates how predefined Python "actions" can be executed from JavaScript to interact with the webpage or perform utility tasks. This application runs entirely client-side, requiring no special server setup.

## Files

The project consists of the following key files:

*   `index.html`: The main HTML file that structures the web page.
*   `main.js`: Contains the JavaScript logic for initializing Pyodide, handling user interactions (button clicks), executing Python code, and managing communication between JavaScript and Python.
*   `actions.py`: An example Python script containing functions that can be called from JavaScript. These actions demonstrate interacting with the DOM and performing simple computations.
*   `ReadMe.md`: The original project proposal document (to distinguish from this README).

## How to Use

1.  Clone or download the project files.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser that supports WebAssembly (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).

No server setup is required as the application runs entirely in the browser.

## Features

### Python Interpreter

*   **Code Input:** A text area (`<textarea id="python-code">`) is provided where users can type or paste their Python code.
*   **Execution:** Clicking the "Run Python Code" button (`<button id="run-button">`) executes the Python code entered in the text area.
*   **Output Display:** The standard output (from `print()` statements) and any error messages generated by the Python code are displayed in a preformatted text area (`<pre id="output-area">`) below the run button.

### Example Actions

This application includes a section to demonstrate calling specific Python functions ("actions") from JavaScript.

*   **Word Count:**
    *   **Input:** Users can type text into an input field (`<input type="text" id="text-input-for-word-count">`).
    *   **Action:** Clicking the "Count Words" button (`<button id="word-count-button">`) triggers a Python function (`count_words` in `actions.py`) that counts the words in the provided text.
    *   **Result:** The word count is displayed in a span (`<span id="action-result-display">`).
*   **Add Paragraph:**
    *   **Input:** Users can type text into an input field (`<input type="text" id="text-input-for-add-paragraph">`).
    *   **Action:** Clicking the "Add Paragraph to Output Area" button (`<button id="add-paragraph-button">`) triggers a Python function (`add_paragraph` in `actions.py`). This function creates a new HTML paragraph element containing the input text and appends it to the main output area (`<pre id="output-area">`), demonstrating DOM manipulation from Python.

## Technology Used

*   **Pyodide:** Used to run Python code in the browser via WebAssembly. It provides the CPython interpreter compiled to Wasm and tools for communication between JavaScript and Python.
*   **HTML:** Structures the web page and its elements.
*   **JavaScript:** Handles user interactions, manages the Pyodide instance, and facilitates the execution of Python code and actions.
