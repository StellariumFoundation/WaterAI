**1. Introduction & Vision**

**1.1. The Imperative for Augmented Human Intelligence**
Humanity is on the verge of a new epoch, one demanding enhanced capabilities to navigate complex challenges and seize unprecedented opportunities. The power of individual intellect, while immense, requires amplification to fully unlock our collective potential. We need intelligent tools that don't just assist but *fundamentally augment* our ability to create, solve, and innovate.

**1.2. Introducing Water AI: The Open-Source AI Supermodel for Human Augmentation**
**Water AI** is the Stellarium Foundation's answer to this imperative. It is a visionary **Open-Source AI Supermodel** – a unified, intelligent platform designed to serve as a universal force-multiplier for human endeavor, supercharging labor and amplifying human efforts. Water AI is not another fragmented tool; it's a comprehensive, collaborative ecosystem that intelligently orchestrates the world's most advanced and specialized Artificial Intelligence capabilities into seamless, actionable solutions. It aims to be the definitive co-pilot for any task, project, or creative pursuit, transforming how we work, create, and solve problems.

**1.3. Core Philosophy: An Open-Source Gift for Humanity, A Tool for Universal Elevation**
Driven by the Stellarium Foundation's ethos, Water AI is conceived as an **open-source gift to humanity**. Its primary purpose is to democratize access to cutting-edge AI, unlock latent human potential, supercharge labor, and accelerate positive global change through a collaborative, open development model. While designed for sustainable operation, its core mission is to elevate and empower everyone. The commitment to being an open-source project with client-side operational capabilities is central to this vision.

**1.4. Relationship to "Elevation to Eden" and Other Stellarium Initiatives**
Water AI is a critical enabler of the Stellarium Foundation's grand vision for an **"Elevation to Eden"** – a future of abundance where human beings are free to pursue higher purposes. While initiatives like **[Water Company](https://www.notion.so/Water-Company-19bc1c04bbc180f188c1cd6f8d5c4681?pvs=21)** focus on autonomous AI labor, Water AI empowers individuals to operate at an amplified capacity within this new paradigm, providing the tools for the creativity and innovation essential for such a society.

**2. The Problem: The Fragmentation of AI & Untapped Human Potential**

The AI revolution is here, yet its power remains fragmented. This fragmentation limits true human augmentation, leaving enormous potential untapped.
*   **Fragmented AI Ecosystem:** Users navigate a complex landscape of specialized AI tools without unified access or intelligent orchestration.
*   **Limited General Models:** Versatile AI systems often lack the deep, nuanced expertise required for many specialized professional and creative tasks across all domains.
*   **The Gap Between Information and Action:** Many AI tools provide information but fall short of performing concrete, actionable digital labor.
*   **Untapped Human Potential:** Vast reserves of creativity, productivity, and problem-solving capabilities remain unrealized due to the lack of a unified, intelligent force-multiplier. Humanity needs such a tool to bridge these gaps.

**3. Our Solution: Water AI – The Unified AI Supermodel**

Water AI is the breakthrough: an AI Supermodel designed to intelligently aggregate the world's best specialized AI capabilities and action-taking prowess into a single, accessible platform. It’s AGI in its most practical and impactful form, designed to seamlessly augment any facet of human endeavor.

*   **Intelligent Orchestration:** Routes complex user requests to optimal specialized AI models.
*   **Best-of-Breed Integration:** Aggregates world-class, state-of-the-art AI capabilities from diverse sources.
*   **Action-Taking System:** Goes beyond information to *execute tasks* across digital domains, performing actual labor.

**4. Why Water AI Thrives: Key Differentiators**

**## Setup and Running the Project**

To set up and run this project, follow these steps:

1.  **Ensure `uv` is installed.** If not, follow the installation instructions at https://github.com/astral-sh/uv.

2.  **Clone the repository (if you haven't already):**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```

3.  **Run `make build` to set up the project's virtual environment and install dependencies using uv.**
    This command will:
    * Verify `uv` is installed (or prompt you to install it).
    * Create a virtual environment named `.venv` if it doesn't exist.
    * Install dependencies from `requirements.txt` into the virtual environment.
    *Note: Ensure you are in the root directory of the cloned repository when running this command.*

4.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    The application uses environment variables for configuration, particularly for connecting to LLM services. Refer to the `RUNNING_WITH_LOCAL_MODELS.md` guide for detailed instructions on setting up environment variables like `OPENAI_BASE_URL` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` if you plan to use a local model with LMStudio. For other LLM providers, set the appropriate API keys and endpoints as environment variables according_to_their_documentation. You might need to create a `.env` file in the root directory to store these variables (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`).

5.  **Running the Command-Line Interface (CLI):**
    The `cli.py` script allows you to interact with the agent directly from your terminal.
    ```bash
    python cli.py --prompt "Your instruction to the agent"
    ```
    For more options, run:
    ```bash
    python cli.py --help
    ```

6.  **Running the WebSocket Server (for Web UI):**
    The `ws_server.py` script starts a WebSocket server, which can be used by a frontend application to interact with the agent.
    ```bash
    python ws_server.py
    ```
    By default, the server runs on `0.0.0.0:8000`. You can customize the host and port using command-line arguments:
    ```bash
    python ws_server.py --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080
    ```
    Refer to `python ws_server.py --help` for more options.

**9. Open Source Strategy: Collaborative Development for Universal Benefit**

Water AI is fundamentally an **open-source super AI model** project (e.g., Apache 2.0, MIT license). This approach is chosen to foster transparency, trust, global community contribution, and rapid adoption, directly aligning with the "open-source gift for humanity" philosophy. The project aims to create a vibrant ecosystem where developers worldwide can contribute to building and refining the AI Supermodel, ensuring it remains a cutting-edge tool for amplifying human efforts and supercharging labor. This collaborative model will be balanced with strategies for sustainable monetization to support the project's growth and infrastructure. Community engagement via GitHub, forums, and clear contribution guidelines will be paramount.

This project, Water AI, builds upon the foundations laid by the "Ii agent" project (https://github.com/Intelligent-Internet/ii-agent). The "Ii agent" project is also open-sourced under the Apache License 2.0. We gratefully acknowledge the work of the "Ii agent" contributors and aim to continue in this spirit of open collaboration.

**10. Business Model: Sustainable Impact & Growth**

Water AI is envisioned as an open-source gift to humanity, with a sustainable model that balances universal accessibility with operational sustainability. Our approach ensures the platform can grow through community collaboration and support, while remaining true to its mission of democratizing advanced AI capabilities for amplifying human efforts and supercharging labor.
*   **Community Support & Contributions:** Voluntary user donations, patronage, and active participation in open-source development.
*   **Enterprise Solutions:** Optional volume licensing and tailored support services for businesses that require dedicated instances or SLAs.
